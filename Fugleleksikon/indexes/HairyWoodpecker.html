            <h1>About the Hairy Woodpecker</h1>
            <article class="">
                <p>
                    Like a large, long-billed version of the downy woodpecker, the hairy is a widespread generalist of a variety of forests and woodlands over most of the continent. Polytypic. Length 9".

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <article class="">
                <p>
                    Plumage pattern is nearly identical to the downy’s, with long white patch down the back, variable white spotting on the wing coverts and flight feathers, and mostly unmarked underparts. The outer tail feathers are usually unmarked white. Adult: male shows red nuchal bar, often divided vertically by black (especially in some eastern populations); red is lacking in female.

            <h2>Voice</h2>
            <article class="">
                <p>
                    Call: a piercing, sharp peek or pee-ik. The rattle call (“whinny”) is a fast, slightly descending series of these peek calls. Drum: rapid roll of about 25 beats in 1 second.

            <h2>Status and Distribution</h2>
            <article class="">
                <p>
                    Fairly common; uncommon to rare in the South and Florida. Year-round: the hairy occupies a wide range of coniferous and deciduous forests from sea level to tree line; such habitats are usually densely wooded, but in some areas are more open and parklike. Dispersal: although generally nonmigratory, individuals can disperse long distances, and small irruptive movements sometimes occur. Larger, more northerly birds regularly occur in the Northeast in fall and winter. Recorded in fall and winter on the southern plains and Pacific coast lowlands well away from breeding habitats.
